## About the project
In this project i present networks for neuro data analization. The main perpose of this project was to get accurate EEg to 3d BOLD FMRI-like scence approch based on 3d CNN GAN-like models. Here you can see results of modeling on the rich side and related data from true data distribution.

Also in this project you will find attempts to reconstruct images that was shown to the test subjects during the EEG-FMRI scanning. On image above you find images from cifar10 dataset that was recoverd from test subjects visual cortex recordings during the tests

Data were taken from datasets towards the linkcs: 
BOLD-5000 dataset wich is consist from 3d BOILD FMRI data of visual cortex activities correlated with images wich was shown to the experimental test subjects
```

```
EEG-FMRI dataset with the set of 3d FMRI data correlated with EEG samples for EEG2FMRI projections

```

## TODO
There is still some sutf that me done in this projection. So you can observ TODO list above
- [x] write EEg to 3d projection model.
- [x] images reconstractions from visual cortex of brain.
- [ ] automated model trainers.
- [ ] other utils.
